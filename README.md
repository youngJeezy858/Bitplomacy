Bitplomacy
=========

This is our Senior Design project for EE/CS/CPE 481.  It is a slightly different version of the game "Diplomacy".  
For the engine we use Erebos - an open source project that uses openGL with C based wrappers so that java developement
is simple and easy to use.  For questions about the game engine please contact [emails/URL to come].

Current build can be run and developed on any OS with an up to date JRE. Enjoy!
